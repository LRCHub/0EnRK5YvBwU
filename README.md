[00:18.73] First things first: Rest In Peace Uncle Phil, for real
[00:23.36] You the only father that I ever knew
[00:25.30] I get my bitch pregnant, I'mma be a better you
[00:27.77] Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville, fulfilled
[00:32.98] Listen even back when we was broke my team ill
[00:35.31] Martin Luther King would have been on Dreamville
[00:37.57] Talk to a nigga...
[00:46.57] 
[00:38.71] One time for my LA sisters
[00:40.95] One time for my LA hoes
[00:43.34] Lame niggas can't tell the difference
[00:46.05] One time for a nigga who know
[01:00.55] 
[00:47.97] Don't save her
[00:48.97] She don't wanna be saved
[00:50.14] Don't save her
[00:51.37] She don't wanna be saved

[00:57.88] No role models and I'm here right now
[01:00.26] No role models to speak of
[01:01.72] Searchin' through my memory
[01:03.17] My memory, I couldn't find one
[01:04.62] Last night I was gettin' my feet rubbed
[01:06.66] By the baddest bitch; not Trina, but I swear to God
[01:08.90] This bitch'll make you call your girl up and tell her
[01:10.97] "Hey, what's good?"
[01:11.93] "Sorry I'm never comin' home, I'mma stay for good"
[01:13.96] Then hang the phone up, and proceed to lay the wood
[01:16.36] I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
[01:20.02] Ain't got no shame bout it
[01:21.39] She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich cause I can have any bitch
[01:23.73] I got defensive and said "Nah, I was the same without it"
[01:26.12] But then I thought back, back to a better me
[01:28.77] Before I was a B-list celebrity
[01:30.62] Before I started callin' bitches "bitches" so heavily
[01:32.93] Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
[01:35.44] You wasn't sweatin' me
[01:46.44]
